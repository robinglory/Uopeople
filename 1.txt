Hello everyone, My name is Yan Naing Kyaw Tint, just called me Robin, it is easier. My nationality is Myanmar.
I am 3rd year University student but Coup in my country force our education stopped. So I choose Uopeople because it is 
an international distance learning university with affordable prices. My hoppies is listening to music and watching some 
movies. My passion is creating new software and I truly wanted to know about computer sicene inside and out. I am pretty sure
learning computer science degreen in Uopeople will statisfy my passion. Keen on making some new friends for this marathon journey.
Thanks you Mr Irwa!
